Research Question:
How does information load interact with sociolinguistic metalinguistic awareness?


Hypotheses: 
1. Information load affects the probability of hypercorrection of a stigmatized marker, such that the probability of hypercorrection increases with the magnitude of the information load. 
	a. In Utahn English, t-strenghening will occur at a higher rate based on the increase in the magnitude of the information load.
		- Why Utahn English?
		- operationalized as surprisal?
		- Using Cloze as the operationalization?
	b. This will be true for all stigmatized markers.
